I am a Master student at at the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) of of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). I also work as a researcher at the Spoken Language Systems (LSV) group led by [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I work in two SFB projects: [1102 C4:Mutual Intelligibility and Surprisal in Slavic Intercomprehension](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/mutual-intelligibility-and-surprisal-in-slavic-intercomprehension-incomslav/) and  [1102 B4: Modelling and Measuring Information Density](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/modeling-and-measuring-information-density/).

I'm currently exploring language modelling and interpretability in the context of automatic speech recognition. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or talk over a cup of chai.
